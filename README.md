# TextReplacer

**Class:** Utility

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux

This replaces text.
In a directory.
In all the files inside.
Easy-peasy. :)

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the TextReplacer project after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat directory searchfor replacewith
```

Or under Linux:

```
run.sh directory searchfor replacewith
```

Where `directory` is the directory in which this should be executed, `searchfor` is the text that should be searched, and `replacewith` is the text that all occurrences of `searchfor` should be replaced with.
